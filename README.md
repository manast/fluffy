# Fluffy!

Fluffy! was a game for Spectravideo 328 created by JTM Software.
This game has one of the best graphics seen on the SVI328. The game itself is a platform/puzzle game which really well designed levels and increadible difficulty, but nevertheless a lot of fun to play.
Sadly this game did not gain a lot of recognition outside from Sweden, so this is a port to javascript
so that the game can be played by anyone on a standard browser.

# Objective

The game objective is to pick all the carrots in every level (10 in total), so that Fluffy can get out
of the rooms and find its mother.

# Controls

Use standad arrow keys for moving Fluffy around, space to grab/drop bombs and ESC to commit suicide when Fluffy gets trapped somewhere.

# About the port

This port tries to be as faithful to the original so all the graphics, levels, bomb times, etc, have been extracted from the original game ROM and are rendered similarly as how an SVI328 does it.

The sounds are not exactly as in the original game but quite similar. The latest version of the game
will be available at https://manast.github.io/fluffy.

# Missing stuff that will be eventually implemented

- Presentation screen
- Passwords to allow starting from levels 3, 5, 7 and 9.
- Highscores
- Trampoline animation

# Translation of the original flyer

This is Fluffy!
Your task is to help little Fluffy! out of the seemly infinite and dark passages and find his mother that is worried waiting for him. On your journey will You and Fluffy! meet many dangers. Angry parrots that will hunt you. Abysses that will cheat you around every corner. Old elevators that risk falling down...

But not enough with that, in order to avoid Fluffy! to starve to death he needs to find carrots all the time. So hurry up, because you do not have so much time.

The most important tool Fluffy! has in order to get through all the falling passages and protect himself from the parrots is the bombs. But these are very unreliable and this is where your sense of strategy and logical thinking will play out...

These are some of the ingredients in Fluffy!

- 10 levels
- 40 rooms
- 100% machine code
- Super HI-RES Graphics
- Tons of sound effects
- Ropes, scaffolding and conveyor belts
- Elevators, jumping mattresses, pipes
- Dangerous parrots
- High explosive bombs

- A lot more...
